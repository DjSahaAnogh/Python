# Python
This is my first python repository. In this repository I will learn all python concept. 
I'm a new python beginner. I'm working on different python concepts and adding new codes and files. 

## About new_world.py
This is a draft file. I work on it as draft and then move the codes to a new file and name it according to 
my work. Like the calculator.py, I wrote the code in new_world.py then move it to calculator.py.

## About me
My name is Dhanonjoy Saha Anogh. I'm from Bangladesh. I read in class VIII. This repo is 
my very first repository that I have been working on it for a long time. So don't mind if it looks worst.
